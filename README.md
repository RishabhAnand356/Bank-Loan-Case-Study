Analyzing Bank Risk Appetite: An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Approach
Understanding the Problem

Banks need a robust system to assess the risk associated with each loan application. By analyzing historical data, banks can identify patterns and trends that can inform their decision-making process.

Data Exploration and Analysis

Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Handle missing values: Replace missing values with appropriate imputation techniques (e.g., mean, median, mode, or predictive modeling).
Outlier detection: Identify and handle outliers using statistical methods or visualization techniques.
Data normalization: Scale numerical variables to a common range to ensure fair comparison.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Univariate Analysis:

Numerical Variables:
Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, quartiles)
Visualize distributions using histograms and box plots

Categorical Variables:
Calculate frequencies and proportions
Visualize using bar charts and pie charts


Bivariate Analysis:

Numerical-Numerical:
Correlation analysis (Pearson's correlation coefficient, Spearman's rank correlation)
Scatter plots

Numerical-Categorical:
Grouped box plots
Bar charts with error bars

Categorical-Categorical:
Contingency tables
Chi-square test of independence

Identifying Risk Factors:

Credit Score: Analyze the relationship between credit score and loan default rates.
Income: Assess the impact of income levels on loan repayment.
Debt-to-Income Ratio: Analyze the relationship between debt-to-income ratio and loan default rates.
Employment Status: Examine how employment status influences loan repayment behavior.
Loan Amount and Term: Analyze the impact of loan amount and term on default risk.

Building a Risk Model:

Feature Engineering: Create new features based on existing variables (e.g., debt-to-income ratio, income-to-loan ratio).
Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forest) to predict loan default.
Model Training and Evaluation: Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on the training data, and evaluate its performance on the testing data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
